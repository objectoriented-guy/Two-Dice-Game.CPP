# Two-Dice-Game.CPP
This program will begin by asking the user to guess the total that will occur when two dice are rolled. Next, It asked to enter an amount to bet (from $1- $1000). The program then “rolls two dice” (using random numbers) and visually displays the result. Then, if the player’s guess was correct, the player wins 10 times their bet divided by the number of possible ways to get that roll. If the player’s guess was wrong, they lose their bet times the number of possible ways to get their guess.
